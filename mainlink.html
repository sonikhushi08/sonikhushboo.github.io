    <p>Do you have what it takes to make a difference in the world? Of course, you do! Every one of us is put in this world to contribute. No matter age, religion or background, you can make an impact. No matter how large or small, each effort makes an
    important difference. You can change the world by helping one person at a time.
    Simply having the desire to make a difference in the world is enough to start your journey. </p>

  <p>You donâ€™t have to be like Gandhi or Mother Theresa, everyone has the capability of making a difference. It is our responsibility to seek ways to contribute. Start small and local just by adding value to the community where you live. By showing
    concern and love to the people around you, it will cause a ripple effect of positive feelings and spread out into the world.
    Can you imagine if everyone just did this? </p>

  <p> You already have what it takes to make the world a better place.The greatest thing that you can do to make a difference in the world is to be yourself. Be happy with yourself, love yourself. Happiness and love are the two greatest gifts you can
    give to the world so start within you.</p>

  <p>Empower and influence people around you by starting to do things that make a difference.And the best way to convince other people is to lead by example. Every effort counts, no matter how small and insignificant it may seem. Just do something,
    and do something good.</p>

  <p>Many people believe that they donâ€™t have what it takes to make a difference to the world.They believe only people like Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Theresa, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, and the likes, are capable of making a difference.
  </p>

  <p>The truth is, every one of us is put in this world to contribute and make a difference to the world in our own unique way. It need not be anything out of the world. It just needs to be something you do with the intention of â€˜doing goodâ€™. The
    following are some ideas as to how small people like us can make a difference to the world.</em></p>

  <h3><strong>How To Make a Difference </strong></h3>

      </em></p>
  </center>
  <p>There is no one best time to start to make a difference to the world. You donâ€™t need to wait till you have the time to share some love; you donâ€™t have to wait till you make more money to share a slice of bread. Little efforts count, and you can
    start making small contributions today.</p>
    <hr >
  <h3>2. Your Contribution is Never Too Small</h3>
  <center>
    <p><em>Nobody can do everything, but everyone can do something.</em></p>
  </center>
  <ul>
  <li>If you think that everything has been taken care of by somebody and your contribution is not going to make much of a difference, then youâ€™re wrong. Can you imagine if everyone else starts to think the same way?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In fact, it is our responsibility to seek ways to contribute, large and small. You donâ€™t have to be concerned youâ€™re only capable of making small contributions. What counts is the effort.</p>
   <hr >
<h3> 3. Start Now</h3>
